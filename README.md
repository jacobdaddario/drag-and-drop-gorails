# Drag and Drop - Toy App

This repository is the repository for a toy app used to follow episode 343 of the GoRails educational series, [Drag and Drop Sortable Lists with Rails and Stimulus JS](https://gorails.com/episodes/rails-drag-and-drop-sortable?autoplay=1). In it, Chris Oliver recreates a classic episode, instead using StimulusJS and ES6 syntax.

This application was created purely for practice purposes.
